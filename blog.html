        ChatGPT is a seemingly revolutionary new tool that allows one to do just about everything.
        But, is it too powerful? Or we just being tricked to believe that it is? From highly practical applications to
        ethically questionable ones, especially regarding students, tools like this are sure to have a profound impact
        on tech and society in general.

        up CS with these stories in mind, but the landscape has changed significantly. The classic tech success story is
        slowly becoming closer to a dream than the reality it once was. Is this really the end of booming tech or can we
        hope for better times ahead?
