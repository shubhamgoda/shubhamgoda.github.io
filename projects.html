        During my software engineering internship at Roblox, my project was to build an external login flow for the
        Roblox Studio application in C++. Essentially, when the embedded login page fails, my project would redirect
        users to a browser, allow them to login there, and then return them back to the application, which would be
        ready for their use. This was challenging because client application development was different from the normal
        full-stack development I was used to. I had to think about protocol schemes (how to launch an application from a
        browser), OAuth 2.0, sending data between different processes on an OS, and other low level ideas. I really
        enjoyed this as I learned a lot by diving into a new corner of development. The impact of this is that Roblox
        Studio, an application with over 10 million users, now supports an external browser-based login, helping the 5%
        of users whose embedded login was failing to log in. Not only did I learn the cornerstones of application
        development, but also how a good engineering organization operates, from design and technical documentation, to
        communication and presentation, to code reviews, and more.

        While taking ORIE 3120 at Cornell in during the Spring 2021 semester, our final project was to take a large
        dataset and perform interesting, insightful anaylses on this data. My group and I decided to take COVID data and
        political data to see how trends in the 2020 election were affected by the pandemic. Here are our results.

        Ever since I was young, I've always been interested in math and science. One project I did at young age of 11
        was creating these video tutorials explaining how to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest
        common factor (GCF) of a group of numbers. It's really great to see how much I've grown since this early stage!
