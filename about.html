  <p id="story-text" class="text">
    I'm Shubham Goda. My story with software starts in 9th grade at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
    Technology. Ever since then, I've been amazed by the power of software to replicate and improve millions of lives.
    So, I knew this what I wanted to do at Cornell. As a computer science major, I've learned about everything from
    machine learning to operating systems to algorithms to databases. I've done a number of interesting projects, which
    you can see here. And, I've given back as a TA in CS 2110. Finally, I've honed by skills in the industry through
    internships at Roblox, ID.me, and Sestra Systems.

    Currently, I'm a senior at Cornell getting ready to finish my CS degree. I'm actively looking for full-time
    opportunities as a software engineer, and I'm excited to begin my career after graduating. I aim to join a company
    where I can learn, make a large impact, and work on innovative technologies. I'm also taking some interesting
    courses including Databases, Networks, and more.
